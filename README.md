## Introduction

This README provides a detailed overview of the low-level system design for our Parking Lot System. It outlines the components and design considerations that are crucial for building a robust and efficient parking management system.


## Functional Requirements

1. **Vehicle Entry:**
   - The system must allow vehicles to enter the parking lot.
   - It should capture and record vehicle information such as license plate number and entry time.

2. **Parking Spot Allocation:**
   - The system should automatically allocate an available parking spot based on vehicle size and availability.
   - It should ensure that different types of parking spots (e.g., compact, regular, handicap) are appropriately assigned.

3. **Ticket Generation:**
   - Upon vehicle entry, the system must generate a parking ticket.
   - The ticket should include a unique identifier, entry timestamp, and information about the allocated parking spot.

4. **Vehicle Exit:**
   - The system should allow vehicles to exit the parking lot.
   - It should calculate the parking fee based on the time spent in the lot and vehicle type.

5. **Payment Processing:**
   - The system must handle various payment methods, including credit cards, cash, and mobile wallets.
   - It should validate payments and mark parking spots as vacant upon successful payment.

6. **Ticket Validation:**
   - During exit, the system should validate the parking ticket to ensure it corresponds to a valid entry.
   - Invalid or duplicated tickets should be flagged.

7. **Security Monitoring:**
   - The system should monitor the parking lot for security purposes.
   - This includes surveillance cameras, access control, and barrier management.

8. **Reporting and Analytics:**
   - The system should provide reporting and analytics features, such as occupancy statistics, revenue reports, and peak usage times.

9. **Reservation System (Optional):**
   - If applicable, the system may offer a reservation feature, allowing users to reserve parking spots in advance.

10. **User Notifications:**
    - The system should notify users of parking availability, payment status, and any important updates via SMS, email, or mobile app notifications.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance:**
   - The system should handle a high volume of vehicles during peak hours without significant performance degradation.
   - Response times for entry, exit, and payment processing should be minimal.

2. **Scalability:**
   - The system must be scalable to accommodate future expansion, including the addition of more parking spots or parking lots.

3. **Reliability:**
   - The system should be highly reliable, with minimal downtime.
   - It should be able to recover gracefully from system failures or crashes.

4. **Security:**
   - Data security is paramount. The system should protect sensitive user information and payment data.
   - Access to the system should be secure, with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.

5. **Availability:**
   - The system should be available 24/7, with minimal planned downtime for maintenance.

6. **Usability:**
   - The user interfaces, both physical and digital, should be intuitive and user-friendly.
   - Users should be able to complete parking and payment processes with ease.

7. **Compliance:**
   - Ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards for parking management systems, including data privacy and accessibility requirements.

8. **Scalability:**
   - The system should be designed to handle varying levels of traffic, from small parking lots to large, multi-level structures.

9. **Logging and Auditing:**
   - Implement extensive logging and auditing to track system activities, user actions, and security events.

10. **Maintenance and Support:**
    - Provide mechanisms for system maintenance, updates, and support to address any issues promptly.

- Interaction points for entering, exiting, making payments, and retrieving tickets.

### Error Handling

- Robust error-handling mechanisms.
- Handling exceptional scenarios and failures.

### Security

- Ensure data and payment security.
- Access control and authentication mechanisms.

### Logging and Monitoring

- Logging system for recording events and errors.
- Monitoring to detect and respond to anomalies.

### Scalability

- Design considerations for scalability.
- Ability to add more parking spots or handle increased traffic.

### Testing

- Testing strategy, including unit, integration, and system tests.
- Ensure the system functions correctly under various scenarios.

### Documentation

- Maintain detailed documentation for code, APIs, and architecture.
- Aids in future maintenance and development.

### Performance Optimization
