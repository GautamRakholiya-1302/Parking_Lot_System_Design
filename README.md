   - Responsibilities and attributes of parking spots.

2. **Parking Spot**:
   - Explanation of parking spot representation.
   - Attributes and availability status.

3. **Vehicle**:
   - Description of the vehicle component.
   - Attributes like license plate number, type, and timestamps.

4. **Ticketing System**:
   - Role of the ticketing system.
   - How it generates and manages parking tickets.

5. **Payment System**:
   - Responsibilities of the payment system.
   - Accepted payment methods and validation process.

6. **Security System**:
   - Overview of the security system.
   - Components like surveillance cameras, barriers, and access control.

## Low-Level System Design

### Data Structures and Algorithms

- Explain data structures used (e.g., arrays, lists, maps).
- Describe algorithms for spot allocation and fee calculation.

### Concurrency

- How the system handles multiple vehicles entering/exiting simultaneously.
- Ensure thread safety and effective concurrency management.

### Database

- Usage of databases for storing persistent data.
- Database schema design for optimized data management.

### User Interface

- Design of user interfaces for customers (physical and digital).
- Interaction points for entering, exiting, making payments, and retrieving tickets.

### Error Handling

- Robust error-handling mechanisms.
- Handling exceptional scenarios and failures.

### Security

- Ensure data and payment security.
- Access control and authentication mechanisms.

### Logging and Monitoring

- Logging system for recording events and errors.
- Monitoring to detect and respond to anomalies.

### Scalability

- Design considerations for scalability.
- Ability to add more parking spots or handle increased traffic.

### Testing

- Testing strategy, including unit, integration, and system tests.
- Ensure the system functions correctly under various scenarios.

### Documentation

- Maintain detailed documentation for code, APIs, and architecture.
- Aids in future maintenance and development.

### Performance Optimization

- Continuous monitoring and optimization of system performance.
- Especially important during peak usage times.

## Conclusion

This document outlines the low-level design considerations for our Parking Lot System. Implementing these design principles will help us create a robust, efficient, and scalable system.
